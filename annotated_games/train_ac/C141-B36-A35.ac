36 : Architect_A35 : closer , but move the 2nd block to the other 1 37 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0] 38 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 39 : Builder_B36 : good ? 40 : Architect_A35 : now mirror that to the left of the yellow 1 u built 41 : Builder_B36 : in yellow ? 42 : Architect_A35 : in blue 43 : Builder_B36 : ok 44 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 46 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0] 47 : Builder_B36 : like this ? 48 : Architect_A35 : yeah now get on the ground and delete the bottom block of tall column of the blue things u built it should look like floating stairs 49 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 50 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 51 : Architect_A35 : good 52 : Builder_B36 : ok 53 : Architect_A35 : okay now go back to reference it should look like legs and the bottom of a banana to build the body , go to the empty space between the yellow and blue and build 4 high . in yellow 54 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 55 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 57 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 58 : Builder_B36 : like this ? 59 : Architect_A35 : place 2 more blocks 60 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0] 62 : Architect_A35 : delete the bottom 2 on the ground 63 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 64 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 65 : Architect_A35 : okay so from your view point right now , add 3 yellow blocks to the first 3 yellow blocks of the yellow column you're facing add another column of yellow at the same height of the other yellow column u made then delete the topmost block you placed 66 : Builder_B36 : add 3 yellow blocks in which direction ? 67 : Architect_A35 : so you're facing the yellow column 68 : Builder_B36 : ok 69 : Architect_A35 : place in front of that yellow should be building toward u 70 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 71 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1] 72 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1] 73 : Architect_A35 : yeah now to the right of the last yellow block you placed , put a purple block 74 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-2] 75 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-2] 76 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1] 77 : Builder_B36 : like this ? 78 : Architect_A35 : yeah , basically mimic the blue stairs thing you did except now its flipped does that make sense ? so you should place a purple block on top of the 1 you just placed and then 1 to the right of that 79 : Builder_B36 : ooooh 80 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1] 81 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:-1] 82 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1] 83 : Builder_B36 : like this ? 84 : Architect_A35 : do the same thing on the other side 85 : Builder_B36 : ok 86 : Architect_A35 : yeah 87 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1] 88 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 89 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1] 90 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 91 : Builder_B36 : like this ?
