 0 : Builder_B16 : Mission has started . hola 1 : Architect_A29 : hello we're going to build a flower 2 : Builder_B16 : yay ! 3 : Architect_A29 : but it has a pretty complex shape 4 : Builder_B16 : less yay 5 : Architect_A29 : beginning with the stem in green start in the middle so we have some room the stem is 4 tall but the bottom block is shifted out by one 6 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 9 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 10 : Builder_B16 : like this ? 11 : Architect_A29 : yes 12 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 13 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 14 : Architect_A29 : precisely now a purple block symmetric to the bottom green block on top 15 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 16 : Builder_B16 : oh wair 17 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 18 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2] 19 : Architect_A29 : up top 20 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2] 21 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2] 22 : Architect_A29 : great 23 : Builder_B16 : sorry about that 24 : Architect_A29 : no worries , you're still being programmed 25 : Builder_B16 : so true 26 : Architect_A29 : now for the rest of the flower we're are going to make a 3 by 3 square with the purple block as its center but shifted one block away from the purple block does that make sense ? 27 : Builder_B16 : not entirely 28 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-2] 29 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-3] 30 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-2] 31 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-3] 32 : Architect_A29 : make a 3by3 orange square 33 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-3] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-3] 35 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-3] 36 : Architect_A29 : you got it 37 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-3] 38 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-3] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-3] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-3] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-3] 44 : Architect_A29 : perfect 45 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-4] 46 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-4] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-3] 48 : Architect_A29 : plot twist ! 49 : Builder_B16 : ready for it 50 : Architect_A29 : only corners are orange the others should be red 51 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-3] 52 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-3] 53 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-3] 54 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-3] 55 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-3] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-3] 57 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-3] 58 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-3] 59 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3] 61 : Architect_A29 : that's excellent now we're basically going to do the same thing build another square on the rim of that square one block out in yellow 62 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-4] 63 : Builder_B16 : here ? 64 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-5] 65 : Architect_A29 : diagonally 66 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-5] 67 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-4] 68 : Architect_A29 : so this one is 5x5 69 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-4] 70 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-4] 71 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-4] 72 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-4] 73 : Architect_A29 : precisely 74 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-4] 76 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4] 77 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-4] 78 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-4] 79 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-4] 80 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-4] 81 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-4] 82 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:-4] 83 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:6 Z:-4] 84 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:7 Z:-4] 85 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-4] 86 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-4] 87 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-4] 88 : Architect_A29 : excellent now plot twist ! 89 : Builder_B16 : it's already beautiful alright ! 90 : Architect_A29 : the middle blocks are red on each side 91 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-4] 92 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-4] 93 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-4] 94 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-4] 95 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-4] 96 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-4] 97 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-4] 98 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-4] 99 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4] 100 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-4] 101 : Architect_A29 : finally remove every block that isn't red or a corner block 102 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:6 Z:-4] 103 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-4] 104 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-4] 105 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-4] 106 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-4] 107 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-4] 108 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-4] 109 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-4] 110 : Architect_A29 : great work !
