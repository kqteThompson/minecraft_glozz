 0 : Builder_B16 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A26 : Ok , this structure will take some space , so I would back up a few steps We 'll start with a yellow row of length 4 2 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3] 3 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3] 4 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3] 5 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3] 6 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3] 8 : Architect_A26 : actually , could you rotate the row ? 9 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4] 10 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4] 11 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3] 12 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3] 13 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-4] 15 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-5] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2] 17 : Architect_A26 : Awesome ! Now in front and behind the block you are looking at , add a yellow brick 18 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 20 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 21 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 22 : Architect_A26 : Nice ! now we 'll add two green bricks diagonal to the top of the cross So that there is a yello- yellow - green diagonal 23 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 24 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1] 25 : Architect_A26 : Perfect ! Now we 'll move to the second layer We 'll actually make the same cross plus two diagonals twice , but in different places with different colors 26 : Builder_B16 : okay ! 27 : Architect_A26 : The first one will be red and orange , where the bottom of the crossis three to the left and one above the top of the yellow cross 28 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2] 29 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2] 30 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2] 31 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 32 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 33 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2] 36 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 38 : Architect_A26 : Sorry , other side of the cross ! 39 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 40 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 41 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 42 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-2] 44 : Architect_A26 : You have the right idea 45 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-1] 46 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-1] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-2] 48 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-2] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-1] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:2 Z:0] 51 : Architect_A26 : That brick should be one spot to your left 52 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:5 Y:2 Z:0] 53 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-1] 54 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-2] 55 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0] 57 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-2] 58 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0] 59 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-2] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:0] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:1] 62 : Architect_A26 : You 've got it ! 63 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0] 64 : Architect_A26 : So as a reminder , you 'll make the same structure , but with red and orange 65 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:2 Z:0] 66 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:2] 67 : Architect_A26 : You 've got it 68 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:2 Z:2] 69 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:2] 70 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2] 71 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2] 72 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2] 73 : Architect_A26 : The next shape we 'll make will be purple and blue It will also be on the second layer The blue bricks will 3 in front of and 5 in front of the top of the yellow cross 74 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:1] 75 : Architect_A26 : Not quite 76 : Builder_B16 : here ? 77 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:1] 78 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:2] 79 : Architect_A26 : You were actually just there Perfect Ah wait , ok , that was bad on my part 80 : Builder_B16 : no problem ! 81 : Architect_A26 : So the blue bricks will be on the same line as the yellow bricks 82 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:2] 83 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2] 84 : Builder_B16 : here ? 85 : Architect_A26 : one to the left and one to the right of there ! 86 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 87 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3] 88 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2] 89 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2] 90 : Architect_A26 : As well as up a layer 91 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2] 92 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2] 93 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2] 94 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1] 95 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 96 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:3] 97 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3] 98 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2] 99 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2] 100 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2] 101 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2] 102 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2] 103 : Architect_A26 : You got it ! positioning these without using xyz coordinates can be tricky 104 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2] 105 : Builder_B16 : true ! no problem though 106 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 107 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3]
