Now put a yellow block on top of the middle of the orange row , and red for the rest of that row 36 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0] 38 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 41 : Architect_A41 : Now a row of orange on top of that 42 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:0] 46 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0] 47 : Architect_A41 : Now a row with a red in the middle , and purple otherwise 48 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:6 Z:0] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:6 Z:0] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:6 Z:0] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:0] 52 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:6 Z:0] 53 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0] 54 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 55 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0] 57 : Architect_A41 : Perfect . Now a row of three purple , centered on the red 58 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0] 59 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:0] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:7 Z:0] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:7 Z:0] 62 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:0] 63 : Architect_A41 : Great now we will remove some . Remove the two purples on either side of the highest red block 64 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:6 Z:0] 65 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0] 66 : Architect_A41 : Now remove three oranges from the next row down , the left right and middle oranges 67 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0] 68 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0] 69 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0] 70 : Architect_A41 : Great . Now remove two red blocks from the next row down , so it forms a checkerboard pattern with the row above 71 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0] 72 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 73 : Architect_A41 : Cool , now three oranges from the next row down , so it continues the checkerboard pattern 74 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 75 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 76 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 77 : Architect_A41 : Okay now the two purples at the ends of the next row down . The whole shape should be symmetric 78 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0] 79 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0] 80 : Architect_A41 : Perfect , we are done !
