22 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3] 23 : Architect_A36 : ya then on either side of the red block , put down 2 red blocks 24 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1] 25 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 27 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1] 28 : Architect_A36 : to the left and right good u see how it's a row of 5 right 29 : Builder_B31 : yep 30 : Architect_A36 : get rid of the 2nd the 4th blocks 31 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 32 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 33 : Architect_A36 : o wait can u move those 1 space closer to the yellow block sorry 34 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 36 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 37 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1] 38 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 39 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1] 40 : Builder_B31 : its all good 41 : Architect_A36 : ok good the bottom layer is a 5 x 5 square with spaces in between like the row you just put down so it should only be 3 squares per row 42 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4] 46 : Builder_B31 : like that for all three ? 47 : Architect_A36 : ya 48 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 52 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-3] 54 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4] 55 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4] 56 : Architect_A36 : then get rid of the red square on the ground in front of you 57 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 58 : Architect_A36 : and do that for the other columns 59 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3] 60 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4] 61 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-3] 62 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4] 63 : Architect_A36 : and then do the same for the red squares 3 spaces in front of you 64 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 65 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1] 66 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 67 : Architect_A36 : oh the yellow block should be on top of the middle red one sorry 68 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 69 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 70 : Architect_A36 : like floating ya good ok then for the layer in between the yellow and red is orange so at the corners of the yellow there's an orange block 71 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 72 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 73 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 74 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-3] 76 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 77 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3] 78 : Builder_B31 : like that ? 79 : Architect_A36 : ya like that 80 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2] 81 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 82 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 83 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 84 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2] 85 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-3] 86 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2] 87 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 88 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2] 89 : Architect_A36 : ok then the next layer on top of the yellow block is green 90 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2] 91 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 92 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1] 93 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2] 94 : Builder_B31 : do they go on the corners ? 95 : Architect_A36 : ya but only 2 blocks instead of 4 96 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 97 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 98 : Builder_B31 : like that ? 99 : Architect_A36 : close , the green blocks should be diagonal sorry 100 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1] 101 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1] 102 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1] 103 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0] 104 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1] 105 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1] 106 : Builder_B31 : like that diagonal ? 107 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2] 108 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3] 109 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2] 110 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3] 111 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2] 112 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 113 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2] 114 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3] 115 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2] 116 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 117 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 118 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 119 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2] 120 : Architect_A36 : ya then you can add another diagonal block to that 121 : Builder_B31 : or across like that 122 : Architect_A36 : you * you're on the right track u know how u have the one green block right now 123 : Builder_B31 : lol do i need to delete anything from this configuration ? yes 124 : Architect_A36 : no you're good 125 : Builder_B31 : okay 126 : Architect_A36 : add another diagonal block to that 127 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-3] 128 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-3] 129 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-4] 130 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-3] 131 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-3] 132 : Architect_A36 : ok then one more 133 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-4] 134 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-5] 135 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:-5] 136 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-4] 137 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-5] 138 : Builder_B31 : both side ? 139 : Architect_A36 : pmg wait oh no i think it's outside of the building space 140 : Builder_B31 : the green one is still good 141 : Architect_A36 : o wait it is good lol u know how the other green diagonal only has 2 blocks 142 : Builder_B31 : yes , do i need to add another 143 : Architect_A36 : ya 144 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:6 Z:0] 145 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:6 Z:0] 146 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:3 Y:6 Z:1] 147 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:6 Z:0] 148 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:3 Y:6 Z:0] 149 : Architect_A36 : ok let me check to see if we need anything else ok i think we're good 150 : Builder_B31 : perfect
