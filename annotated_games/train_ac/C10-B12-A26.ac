 0 : Builder_B12 : Mission has started . ready 1 : Architect_A26 : We will start on the ground , placing red-purple- yellow - yellow - purple - red in a line . Each will have a space in between 2 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-1] 3 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 4 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 5 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 6 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1] 7 : Builder_B12 : like that ? 8 : Architect_A26 : Close , I think on your right it should be yellow - purple - red instead of purple - green 9 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1] 11 : Builder_B12 : ok 12 : Architect_A26 : Now in the center there should be two yellows , not just one 13 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 14 : Architect_A26 : So t6 bricks in total 15 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 16 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 17 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 18 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:-1] 20 : Architect_A26 : Nice Now on the next level , we will be doing red-purple-yellow - purple - red 21 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-1] 22 : Architect_A26 : Again , evenly spaced , and flowing in between each brick 23 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 24 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 25 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1] 27 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:-1] 28 : Architect_A26 : There will be only 5 bricks on the secone level . You may need to place bricks in between your currently existing bricks and then remove the old ones 29 : Builder_B12 : ok 30 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1] 31 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-1] 32 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1] 33 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 35 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 36 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 38 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:-1] 40 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:-1] 41 : Builder_B12 : good ? 42 : Architect_A26 : Good stuff ! Following the same pattern , use 4 bricks now , making a red-purple - purple - red 43 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-1] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1] 45 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-1] 46 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 48 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 51 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 52 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1] 54 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1] 55 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2] 56 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2] 57 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1] 58 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1] 59 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 62 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-1] 64 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1] 65 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-1] 66 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-1] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 68 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:-1] 69 : Builder_B12 : pyramid ? 70 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1] 71 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1] 72 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1] 73 : Architect_A26 : Good work . Hold on on the top layer - although you might expect the same thing , it will be 5 red blocks in a line 74 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1] 75 : Builder_B12 : which layer ? 76 : Architect_A26 : the 4th layer 77 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 78 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2] 79 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1] 80 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2] 81 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1] 82 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1] 83 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 84 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 85 : Builder_B12 : thusly ? 86 : Architect_A26 : Cool ! Now one last touch , in between the two purple bricks , add a purple brick It should make three arches 87 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2] 88 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 89 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2]
