Now go to the lower righthand corner of the two Behind the right - most green block , place a purple block 26 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 27 : Builder_B34 : there ? that's behind 28 : Architect_A31 : Yes , that's good 29 : Builder_B34 : gr8 30 : Architect_A31 : Now moving right , place two more purple blocks 31 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0] 32 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0] 33 : Architect_A31 : This one will be an 8 34 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:2 Z:0] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:3 Z:0] 36 : Builder_B34 : same height ? 37 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0] 38 : Architect_A31 : Correct , same height 39 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:4 Z:0] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:5 Z:0] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:4 Y:4 Z:0] 46 : Builder_B34 : like that ? 47 : Architect_A31 : That's good Now come to the side of the 8 so the 2 is behind the 8 Go to the bottom righthand corner of the 8 Place a yellow block diagonal to the corner of the 8 48 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 49 : Builder_B34 : there ? 50 : Architect_A31 : Yes Now two more yellow blocks to the right of that 51 : Builder_B34 : alright . What number is this ? 52 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 54 : Architect_A31 : 6 55 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 57 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 58 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 59 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1] 62 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1] 64 : Builder_B34 : like that ? 65 : Architect_A31 : Nice , that's perfect Now go to the bottom right corner of the 6 I 'm sorry , bottom left corner . My mistake 66 : Builder_B34 : you good 67 : Architect_A31 : Place an orange block right infront of that yellow block 68 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2] 69 : Architect_A31 : Good , now make it a tower the same heigh as the other numbers 70 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2] 71 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2] 72 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2] 73 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-2] 74 : Architect_A31 : Nice , it will be a 7 . So we just need two more orange blocks off the left side of the tower 75 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-2] 76 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:5 Z:-2] 77 : Architect_A31 : Fantastic .
