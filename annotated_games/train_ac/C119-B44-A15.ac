build a row of purple blocks on top of the pillars to connect them 25 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2] 27 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2] 28 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2] 29 : Architect_A15 : and extend that row outwards to build a 4x4 square parallel to the ground , on the opposite side you're currently standing 30 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 31 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0] 32 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1] 33 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 36 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 38 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1] 42 : Architect_A15 : okay , good ! go back over to the other side and remove the two purple blocks on the corners 43 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1] 44 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1] 45 : Architect_A15 : and replace them with blue blocks 46 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1] 48 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1] 50 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1] 51 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1] 52 : Architect_A15 : build a diagonal staircase on both sides , extending from the blue blocks towards the ground 53 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1] 54 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2] 55 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2] 57 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3] 58 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2] 59 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:4] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2] 62 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2] 64 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:3] 65 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2] 66 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:4] 67 : Architect_A15 : perfect ! extend those staircases in the other direction by two blocks on each side , so on top of the purple square 68 : Builder_B44 : I 'm confused 69 : Architect_A15 : my bad D : so , get on top of the structure place a blue block on top of the purple blocks on the sides 70 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2] 71 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1] 72 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:0] 73 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-2] 74 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0] 76 : Architect_A15 : like that , but without the backmost two blue blocks on each side 77 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1] 78 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-2] 79 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1] 80 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-2] 81 : Architect_A15 : and then one more blue block on each side , one tile above and behind the current two so it's a 6 - block staircase 82 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1] 83 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:-1] 84 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1] 85 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1] 86 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1] 87 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 88 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1] 89 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1] 90 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1] 91 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1] 92 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1] 93 : Architect_A15 : perfect ! now , put a green block on top of the second highest blue stair on either side 94 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:0] 95 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:0] 96 : Architect_A15 : and extend those one more green block on either side , so they're above the 3rd highest blue blocks 97 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:1] 98 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1] 99 : Architect_A15 : and stack a green block on top of those last two 100 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:6 Z:1] 101 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:1] 102 : Architect_A15 : and remove the bottom two green blocks 103 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1] 104 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:1] 105 : Architect_A15 : and finally , connect the outermost green blocks with two more green blocks 106 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1] 107 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:1] 108 : Architect_A15 : perfect ! sorry for the confusion 109 : Builder_B44 : nice
