 0 : Builder_B44 : Mission has started . ready 1 : Architect_A15 : okay , this one may take a bit . start by making a row of 4 yellow blocks on the ground , starting in the very center 2 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 3 : Builder_B44 : which direction do youw ant the row 4 : Architect_A15 : and from the centermost yellow block , make another row of 4 perpendicular any direction ! it will ultimately be an L shape parallel to the ground 5 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 6 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0] 11 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0] 12 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:0] 13 : Architect_A15 : and connect the endmost yellow blocks to make a triangle 14 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 15 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3] 17 : Architect_A15 : sorry , one more space inwards 18 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3] 19 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2] 20 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 21 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1] 22 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2] 23 : Architect_A15 : perfect ! now , stack another layer of yellow blocks on top of that , then remove the bottom layer 24 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0] 25 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0] 27 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 28 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 29 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3] 30 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 31 : Architect_A15 : so it's the same structure , but one tile off the ground 32 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2] 33 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1] 34 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 35 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:0] 36 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 37 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 38 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 39 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 40 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 41 : Architect_A15 : okay , now , using the innermost corner of the triangle , make a 2x2 square of red blocks but leave the yellow corner as is whoops , sorry okay , move to the corner of the L and place a red block on both remaining sides of the corner 42 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 44 : Architect_A15 : yeah like that . sorry , didn't know how to phrase it and connect those blocks with one more red block 45 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 46 : Architect_A15 : okay , now , hop off the structure to your righthand side and extend the closest row of red blocks to you to a row of 5 red blocks to the right 47 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2] 48 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:4] 50 : Architect_A15 : perfect ! now , put another red block in front of the 2nd rightmost one , so the red structure is symmetrical 51 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3] 52 : Architect_A15 : other side , sorry 53 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3] 54 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3] 55 : Architect_A15 : and one more red block to make a triangle 56 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2] 57 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2] 58 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2] 59 : Architect_A15 : great ! now , place a blue block under that last red one 60 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2] 61 : Architect_A15 : and directly to the left and to the right of that last red one , place another blue block 62 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2] 64 : Architect_A15 : yep ! and then a row of 5 blue blocks on top of those two , to make another triangle 65 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2] 66 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2] 68 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2] 69 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:3 Y:3 Z:2] 70 : Architect_A15 : whoops , hold on okay , make a row of 7 red blocks next to the current row of 5 , so it's a bigger triangle 71 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 72 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 73 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1] 74 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3] 76 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:4] 77 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:5] 78 : Architect_A15 : and remove the innermost three red blocks on the row of 5 , so it's hollow 79 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 80 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2] 81 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3] 82 : Architect_A15 : alright , perfect ! my bad looks good now :) 83 : Builder_B44 : nice
