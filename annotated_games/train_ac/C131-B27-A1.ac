 0 : Builder_B27 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A1 : its a science experiment table ... lets start with red place four blocks at the corner of a 3x6 flat on the ground 2 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3] 3 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 4 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2] 5 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2] 6 : Architect_A1 : great add one more red on top of these 7 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:2] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2] 11 : Architect_A1 : now the table top is yellow make the 3x6 12 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3] 13 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-3] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-3] 15 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 17 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 18 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2] 20 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2] 21 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2] 22 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2] 23 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 24 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 25 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1] 27 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 28 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 29 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2] 30 : Architect_A1 : great we will build on top of this table now place one blue block , one block left of the edge and on the side closest to you 31 : Builder_B27 : is it floating ? 32 : Architect_A1 : its one the table on * 33 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3] 34 : Architect_A1 : its next to that 35 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2] 36 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3] 37 : Architect_A1 : great now on the second corner closest to this blue block place a green block 38 : Builder_B27 : this corner ? 39 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3] 40 : Architect_A1 : thats the first closest corner 41 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-3] 43 : Architect_A1 : yes there now make a step with a green block towards the right from where you are add a green step 44 : Builder_B27 : off of the blue ? 45 : Architect_A1 : of the last block you placed , green 46 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-2] 48 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2] 49 : Architect_A1 : perfect place two purple blocks one he middle of the table 50 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:0] 52 : Architect_A1 : good now delete the one closest to the blue 53 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 54 : Architect_A1 : place a purple block on top of this one 55 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0] 56 : Architect_A1 : good now add a puple block going towards you 57 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0] 58 : Architect_A1 : another puple going away from the blue and green , attached to the second purple block you added 59 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1] 60 : Architect_A1 : not that one the one before it 61 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1] 62 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1] 63 : Architect_A1 : good add one orange block at the corner farthest from the blue 64 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2] 65 : Architect_A1 : good okay , one more orange block and we are done , its not above the table though it a diagonal step connected to the last orange block you placed its * 66 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:3] 68 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:5 Z:3] 69 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2] 70 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:3] 71 : Architect_A1 : yeah thats it
