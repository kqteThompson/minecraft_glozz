 0 : Builder_B16 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A26 : This structure looks fun - nothing will touch the ground ! 2 : Builder_B16 : cool ! 3 : Architect_A26 : We 'll start with a row of 4 purple bricks , a layer above the ground 4 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 5 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1] 6 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1] 10 : Architect_A26 : Great ! now to the left and right of one of the purple bricks in the middle of the row , add orange bricks Sort of like a floating cross if you viewed it from the sky 11 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 12 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2] 13 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2] 15 : Architect_A26 : Great ! we 'll add a two blue bricks , one space away from the orange bricks and diagonally adjacent to the top of the cross You could think of it as adding a row of blue bricks to the top of the cross and then removing the middle brick 16 : Builder_B16 : in the same layer as the rest of the structure ? 17 : Architect_A26 : Yes ! 18 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2] 20 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0] 21 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1] 22 : Architect_A26 : We 'll do that once more ( so the blue bricks are part of a length 2 blue diagonal ) 23 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:0] 24 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:-1] 25 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:0] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:3] 27 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:3] 28 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:3] 29 : Architect_A26 : great ! Now we 'll mve up a layer we 'll start by making the perimeter of a 3x5 orange rectangle the corners of the rectangle touch the orange bricks on the second layer 30 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 31 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 32 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2] 33 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 36 : Architect_A26 : The three bricks you added will be the center of the rectangle 37 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 38 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 39 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 42 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1] 46 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3] 48 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:3] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2] 52 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2] 53 : Architect_A26 : You're close ! try rotating the rectangle 90 degrees 54 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2] 55 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2] 56 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1] 57 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0] 58 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 59 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 60 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1] 61 : Architect_A26 : so if you looked down from the sky , through the rectangle , you would see the orange - purple - orange part of the seoncd layer 62 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2] 63 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2] 64 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:-1] 65 : Architect_A26 : maybe an easier way to put it is to add a brick on top of the brick at the top of the cross 66 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2] 68 : Architect_A26 : Sorry !
