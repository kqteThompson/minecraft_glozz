 0 : Builder_B49 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A39 : hello this one is kind of like a rainbow using three colors it stands up , and all blocks lie within the same plane 2 : Builder_B49 : ready 3 : Architect_A39 : on two edges , along the same row , place a red block at each end 4 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-1] 5 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:-1] 6 : Architect_A39 : now put a purple block to the right of the left red block , leaving a one block gap 7 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 9 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 10 : Architect_A39 : wait sorry , that purple should be on the ground 11 : Builder_B49 : i thought you said it stands up 12 : Architect_A39 : yeah , it will patience ! 13 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 14 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 15 : Architect_A39 : do the same thing on the right side but going inwards 16 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-1] 17 : Architect_A39 : okay , now using the same technique , place yellow blocks relative to those purple blocks 18 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 20 : Architect_A39 : cool now think of these as the bases of three separate arches in those colors 21 : Builder_B49 : i see 22 : Architect_A39 : let's start simple with yellow put a yellow block on the next layer up and between those on the ground 23 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 24 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 25 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 27 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 28 : Architect_A39 : that finishes the yellow arch now for purple on the left purple block , put one purple block diagonally up and right of it 29 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 30 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1] 31 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 32 : Architect_A39 : this whole shape is symmetric , so you can do the same for the other side 33 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 35 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 36 : Architect_A39 : up and right one more time 37 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 38 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-1] 39 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 42 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 43 : Architect_A39 : now connect those two top purple blocks in the middle , on the same level 44 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 45 : Architect_A39 : we 'll do a similar pattern for the red blocks , except now there will be four blocks going up diagonally instead of three 46 : Builder_B49 : connected at the top in the same layer ? 47 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1] 48 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-1] 49 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-1] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1] 52 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 54 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1] 55 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 56 : Architect_A39 : yes , you 'll end up with a row of 5 connected at the top 57 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-1] 58 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:-1] 59 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:-1] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1] 62 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1] 64 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 65 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1] 66 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 68 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1] 69 : Builder_B49 : done 70 : Architect_A39 : cool ! that's our rainbow sort of 71 : Builder_B49 : its not right ? 72 : Architect_A39 : no it's right , it's just not really a rainbow : P 73 : Builder_B49 : oh gotcha
