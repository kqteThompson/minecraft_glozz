Z:-1] 54 : Architect_A1 : great okay now we will make a red ring parrallel to the ground . lets go step by step place two red blocks under each purple top most purple 55 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1] 57 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1] 58 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-1] 59 : Architect_A1 : okay now delete the top two red blocks 60 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-1] 61 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:-1] 62 : Architect_A1 : okay add two blocks to these two red eyes , going away and towards you 63 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-2] 64 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-3] 65 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-2] 66 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-3] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4
