 0 : Builder_B4 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A19 : ok get some yellow blocks in the center of the row , there's a floating block with z= 1 like in the xyz coordinate plane 2 : Builder_B4 : center of which row ? 3 : Architect_A19 : we only need one entire row for this so it doesn't matter which row 4 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4] 5 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:4] 6 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4] 7 : Architect_A19 : yeah now place two on the sides except they're on the ground , z = 0 8 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:4] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:4] 10 : Architect_A19 : ok so now two units from each yellow block on the ground , place a purple block 11 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:4] 12 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:4] 13 : Architect_A19 : now place two purple blocks like before , except two units away from the yellow floating block meaning z = 1 14 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:4] 15 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:4] 16 : Builder_B4 : on top of the other purples ? 17 : Architect_A19 : uh no right next to the ones you just placed , one horizontal space 18 : Builder_B4 : so connecting the purple and yellow diagonally ? 19 : Architect_A19 : yea 20 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:4] 21 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:4] 22 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:4] 23 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:4] 24 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:4] 25 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:4] 26 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:4] 27 : Architect_A19 : yeah like that 28 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:4] 29 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:4] 30 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:4] 31 : Architect_A19 : then 3 purple stacked horizontally on top of the yellow floating block 32 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:4] 33 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:4] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:4] 35 : Architect_A19 : the on the very ends place red blocks the row ends 36 : Builder_B4 : of which row ? 37 : Architect_A19 : the same row 38 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:4] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:4] 40 : Architect_A19 : oh sorry i meant on the ground 41 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:4] 42 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:4] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:4] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:4] 45 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:4] 46 : Architect_A19 : not conected to the other blocks 47 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:4] 48 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:4] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:5 Y:1 Z:4] 50 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:4] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:4] 52 : Architect_A19 : yeah so like the yellow and the purple stack diagonally stack the red ones diagonally in the air 53 : Builder_B4 : okay how many ? 54 : Architect_A19 : till z = 4 55 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:5] 56 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:5] 57 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:4] 58 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:4] 59 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:4 Y:1 Z:4] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:4] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:4] 62 : Architect_A19 : yeah like that 63 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:4] 64 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:4] 65 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:4] 66 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:4] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:4] 68 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:4] 69 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:4] 70 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:4] 71 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:4] 72 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:4] 73 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:4] 74 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:4] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:4] 76 : Architect_A19 : then place 3 red ones directly on top ot the purple ones directly on top 77 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:4] 78 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:4 Z:4] 79 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:4] 80 : Architect_A19 : ok we're done 81 : Builder_B4 : nice
