 0 : Builder_B29 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A1 : this one is pretty complicated . place four blue blocks each on the corner of a 5x5 , build near the corner of the board 2 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:4] 3 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:0] 4 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 5 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4] 6 : Architect_A1 : okay so each of these structures are symmetric , it is a tower of three blue and one orange 7 : Builder_B29 : where ? 8 : Architect_A1 : add two more blocks to each blue 9 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:4] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:4] 11 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 12 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 13 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:0] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:0] 15 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:4] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:4] 17 : Architect_A1 : now add an orange to each blue 18 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:4] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:0] 20 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0] 21 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:4] 22 : Architect_A1 : okay we will try to connect each of these towers using five orange blocks i.e. diagonally but the middle block floating 23 : Builder_B29 : does it matter which I pair ? or are they all connected ? 24 : Architect_A1 : its looks symetric so they are all connected so if you look from the top down it kinda looks like an x , but the thing is that the bridge is one step above the top of the oranges 25 : Builder_B29 : oh so they connect across the center ? 26 : Architect_A1 : yes 27 : Builder_B29 : the bridge ? 28 : Architect_A1 : okay , so first place an orange block next to any of the current tops of the towers 29 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:4] 30 : Architect_A1 : okay now make a 2x2 going towards the other tower 31 : Builder_B29 : the other behind me ? or to my right ? 32 : Architect_A1 : to your right the 2x2 is parallel to the ground 33 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:3] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:3] 35 : Architect_A1 : okay so place one orange block on top of the orange block closes to the middle 36 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:3] 37 : Architect_A1 : okay now delete all of the blocks except the last one you placed and the one on top of the tower 38 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:3] 39 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:3] 40 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:4] 41 : Architect_A1 : okay copy that to all the other towers each going towards the center 42 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:3] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:3] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:3] 45 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:3] 46 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:3] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1] 48 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1] 51 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1] 52 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1] 53 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 54 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:1] 55 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-4 Y:5 Z:1] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:1] 57 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-4 Y:5 Z:1] 58 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-4 Y:4 Z:1] 59 : Architect_A1 : okay add one more orange block in the center making a step 60 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:1] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:1] 62 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:2] 63 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:1] 64 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:1] 65 : Architect_A1 : okay so now we have to T type structures next to this build * so starting with green stand on the middle shadow of the orange tower thing now three blocks to your left place a green block there 66 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 67 : Architect_A1 : actually one more away 68 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 69 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2] 70 : Architect_A1 : okay make a tower of three 71 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2] 72 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2] 73 : Architect_A1 : now make the top of the T add two greens 74 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2] 76 : Architect_A1 : now add one green three blocks to the left and one block towards you 77 : Builder_B29 : in the air ? 78 : Architect_A1 : no on the ground 79 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 80 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 81 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3] 82 : Architect_A1 : actually one more block to the left 83 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3] 84 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3] 85 : Architect_A1 : so thats the bottom of the T again 86 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3] 87 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4] 88 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4] 89 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-3] 90 : Builder_B29 : does it face the same direction ? 91 : Architect_A1 : no its perpendicular 92 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4] 93 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-2] 94 : Architect_A1 : great all done
