 0 : Builder_B34 : Mission has started . how complex ? 1 : Architect_A31 : Some of these objects will be floating 2 : Builder_B34 : is there any oclor we are not using 3 : Architect_A31 : This first one we make will not be. This one will be built on the ground 4 : Architect_A31 : No , we will be using all six colors . We will use yellow first . After we finish this first one , we can use yellow as the 'delete' blockss 5 : Builder_B34 : ok 6 : Architect_A31 : So we will need yellow first . One block away from an edge , put a yellow block near the center 7 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 8 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4] 10 : Builder_B34 : like that ? 11 : Architect_A31 : There ya go , that's good Moving toward the center , place three more yellow blocks 12 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 13 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 15 : Architect_A31 : On either side of the third yellow block , place another yellow so it looks like a cross 16 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 17 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 18 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2] 20 : Architect_A31 : Perfect no more yellow will be needed 21 : Builder_B34 : ok very religious 22 : Architect_A31 : Using green , place two blocks diagonal from the top yellow block 23 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 24 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0] 25 : Builder_B34 : ?? 26 : Architect_A31 : Perfect There will be two other shapes like this , but they will be floating 27 : Builder_B34 : exactly the same ? 28 : Architect_A31 : yes , just oriented differently and using different colors 29 : Builder_B34 : ok 30 : Architect_A31 : Place a yellow block diagonal to the left green block 31 : Builder_B34 : on which side ? 32 : Architect_A31 : top left diagonal of the left green block 33 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 34 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1] 36 : Architect_A31 : Perfect Place a red block on top 37 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 38 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 40 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1] 42 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1] 43 : Architect_A31 : You can delete the yellow Now two reds to the right of the current red 44 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1] 46 : Architect_A31 : I apologize , to the left of the curent red 47 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1] 48 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1] 49 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:1] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:1] 51 : Architect_A31 : Perfect , now make a cross in the same direction of the yellow one 52 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 54 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2] 55 : Architect_A31 : The green blocks will be orange for this one 56 : Builder_B34 : what color are the ear things ? 57 : Architect_A31 : They will also be floating 58 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:3] 59 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:3] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:3] 61 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:2 Z:3] 62 : Architect_A31 : Perfect , now move to the top right corner of the white base Right on the edge , in line with the orange ears , place a yellow block 63 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:3] 64 : Builder_B34 : like that 65 : Architect_A31 : Perfect On top , place a purple block 66 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:3] 67 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:3] 68 : Architect_A31 : Purple will be thecross 69 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:3] 70 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:3] 71 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3] 72 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2] 73 : Architect_A31 : And blue ears 74 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:4] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3] 76 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:4] 77 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2] 78 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3] 79 : Architect_A31 : I made a mistake , the whole purple and blue figure should be one block to the left , toward the red one 80 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2] 81 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:4] 82 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:3] 83 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3] 84 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:4] 85 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2] 86 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2] 87 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:4] 88 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3] 89 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2] 90 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:4] 91 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3] 92 : Architect_A31 : yep , you got it 93 : Builder_B34 : great 94 : Architect_A31 : And let me just double check these Nice
