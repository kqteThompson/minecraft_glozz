 0 : Builder_B54 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A1 : okay this one is sorta diagonal . its a 3 - 1 4 the three is orange 2 : Builder_B54 : I 'm not sure what you mean by 3 - 1 4 3 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 4 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 5 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 6 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 8 : Architect_A1 : the structures are a " 3 " then diagonally behind it a " - " and diagonally behind it a " 1 " and so on 9 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 10 : Architect_A1 : so they are all standing 11 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1] 12 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 13 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 15 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2] 17 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2] 18 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-2] 19 : Builder_B54 : Is this the right idea ? 20 : Architect_A1 : yeah but each structure is really big so lets build it near one of the corners 21 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 22 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 23 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2] 24 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2] 25 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-4] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-4] 27 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-4] 28 : Architect_A1 : okay delete the top two blocks 29 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-4] 30 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-4] 31 : Architect_A1 : can you stand on the other side ? okay now place an orange block next to this one 32 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-4] 33 : Architect_A1 : now make a step to the right sorry i mean make a step structure 34 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-4] 36 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4] 37 : Architect_A1 : great 38 : Builder_B54 : xD Sorry that makes more sense ... 39 : Architect_A1 : lol thats okay . thats the bottom of the 3 now we need that middle part of the 3 is a step to the left 40 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-4] 42 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-4] 43 : Architect_A1 : yes so the three is kinda symmetrical , except some little part which we will make later 44 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-4] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-4] 46 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-4] 47 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-4] 48 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:4 Z:-4] 49 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-4] 50 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-4] 51 : Architect_A1 : how you had it before 52 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-4] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-5] 54 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-4] 55 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-5] 56 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-4] 57 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:4 Y:4 Z:-4] 58 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-4] 59 : Architect_A1 : yes now make the top of the 3 similar to the bottom 60 : Builder_B54 : In the same direction or the opposite ? 61 : Architect_A1 : opposite ? lets try it 62 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-4] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-4] 64 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-4] 65 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-4] 66 : Architect_A1 : oh then its the same direction . sorry 67 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-4] 68 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-4] 69 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-4] 70 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:5 Z:-4] 71 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:4 Y:5 Z:-4] 72 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:5 Z:-4] 73 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:5 Z:-4] 74 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:5 Z:-4] 75 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:5 Y:5 Z:-4] 76 : Architect_A1 : that looks like a 3 77 : Builder_B54 : Just about to say that too xD 78 : Architect_A1 : okay now remember what i said before about this little thing , now we just need to add one more block to this 3 so on the first row make a step to the left 79 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-4] 80 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:5 Y:2 Z:-4] 81 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:5 Y:1 Z:-4] 82 : Architect_A1 : great okay the " - " is only a single yellow bock and two blocks behind the three and one block to the right 83 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-2] 84 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-2] 85 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-2] 86 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-2] 87 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:1 Z:-2] 88 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-3] 89 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-4] 90 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-4] 91 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:3 Z:-4] 92 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-4] 93 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-3] 94 : Builder_B54 : ( sorry about that my finger slipped ) Is that right ?
