okay now on the right most yellow block add three more blocks towards you 18 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-3] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-4] 20 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-5] 21 : Architect_A1 : okay now on the middle add two more blocks so that you connect diagonally the edges 22 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3] 23 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-4] 24 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-3] 25 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-3] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-4] 27 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-4] 28 : Architect_A1 : perfect okay now lets move on to red so add three red blocks in at the top of the arrow .. all still in the same plane 29 : Builder_B27 : is it going out horizontally ? 30 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 31 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 32 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1] 33 : Architect_A1 : two are touching that yellow block 34 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1] 35 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 36 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-2] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-1] 38 : Architect_A1 : great okay now we will add five more red blocks extending on the left most red block similar to how you did before 39 : Builder_B27 : towards me ? 40 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0] 41 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1] 42 : Architect_A1 : yes 43 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:3] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:4] 46 : Architect_A1 : add one red block to make this red structure look symetrical 47 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3] 48 : Architect_A1 : now on the middle red most block add three red blocks going towards you 49 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 51 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1] 52 : Architect_A1 : great now delete the first two blocks you just added 53 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1] 54 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 55 : Architect_A1 : now connect this floating red block with two blocks to the tips of the red structure 56 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2] 57 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2] 58 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2] 59 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 60 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 61 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 62 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0] 63 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0] 64 : Architect_A1 : great now moving on to blue place one blue block under and on top of the red block closest to you 65 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1] 66 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 67 : Architect_A1 : add two bocks each side of this last block you just placed facing away and towards you the top one 68 : Builder_B27 : got it 69 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 70 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1] 71 : Architect_A1 : do that again 72 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1] 73 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1] 74 : Architect_A1 : great just one more blue block in the same place covering the red 75 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1] 76 : Architect_A1 : great
