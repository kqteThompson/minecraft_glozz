 0 : Builder_B31 : Mission has started . 1 : Architect_A23 : this is an elaborate one . 2 : Builder_B31 : let's do it 3 : Architect_A23 : start with four blocks laid in a row in the center 4 : Builder_B31 : does it matter what color ? 5 : Architect_A23 : sorry purple 6 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1] 10 : Architect_A23 : the final product will look like a butterfly . this is its body next , blue blocks 11 : Builder_B31 : got it 12 : Architect_A23 : we are making antennae . from on of the end purple blocks , place a blue block on the corner . 13 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 15 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 16 : Builder_B31 : like that ? 17 : Architect_A23 : not quite 18 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2] 19 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 20 : Builder_B31 : this ? 21 : Architect_A23 : sorry . it should be flat 22 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2] 23 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 24 : Builder_B31 : there ? 25 : Architect_A23 : one closer to you 26 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2] 27 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1] 28 : Architect_A23 : perfect on that same diagonal , place another blue block 29 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-3] 30 : Architect_A23 : perfect . now do that on the other side . 31 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1] 32 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 33 : Architect_A23 : nailed it so the rest of the blocks are orange . 34 : Builder_B31 : okay 35 : Architect_A23 : one second so this is our base . i didn't realize it was floating . copy each block up one , and then remove the ones on the plate aka shift the design up into the air . 36 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 38 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1] 40 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 41 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1] 42 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 43 : System : [Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0] 46 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0] 47 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:1] 48 : Architect_A23 : perfect 49 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2] 50 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-3] 51 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-3] 52 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2] 53 : Builder_B31 : done 54 : Architect_A23 : okay . orange blocks next 55 : Builder_B31 : got it 56 : Architect_A23 : the blue is the head of the butterfly 57 : Builder_B31 : okay 58 : Architect_A23 : so on block down from the purple head , place two orange blocks on the sides of the butterfly body 59 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 61 : Builder_B31 : here ? 62 : Architect_A23 : yes we are going up at an angle . so bear with me . on a side of it , place another orange block going outward 63 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 64 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3] 65 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 66 : Architect_A23 : perfect ! 67 : Builder_B31 : same on the other one ? 68 : Architect_A23 : yes 69 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 70 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1] 71 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 72 : Builder_B31 : if its mirrored you could describe one side and I 'll fill in the other 73 : Architect_A23 : so add one block on both sides of the upper orange block along the same direction as the body . 74 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-3] 75 : Architect_A23 : it is mirrored 76 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1] 77 : Builder_B31 : is that right ? 78 : Architect_A23 : add another block same row , towards the head as well . yes that is correct 79 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-3] 80 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1] 81 : Architect_A23 : perfect . you will be doing the same thing but instead of a row of three , a row of five . one diagonal upwards like before 82 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1] 83 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2] 84 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1] 85 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2] 86 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:2] 87 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2] 88 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2] 89 : Builder_B31 : like that ? 90 : Architect_A23 : yes ! 91 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3] 92 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-4] 93 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-3] 94 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-4] 95 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-4] 96 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-4] 97 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:-4] 98 : Architect_A23 : almost done . we will need to remove the middle block of the orange row with three in it . 99 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1] 100 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-3] 101 : Architect_A23 : yes let me check the design to make sure we have this right 102 : Builder_B31 : okay 103 : Architect_A23 : done !
