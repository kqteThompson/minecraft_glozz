6 : Architect_A39 : yeah 7 : Architect_A39 : we'll first make a yellow v-shape on the ground 8 : Architect_A39 : start by placing a yellow block where you are 9 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4] 10 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-4] 11 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5] 12 : Architect_A39 : then, diagonally left and right but staying on the ground, place two more yellow blocks on each side to make a V 13 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4] 14 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-4] 15 : Builder_B49 : like this? 16 : Architect_A39 : yes, but once more 17 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 18 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 20 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-1] 21 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2] 22 : Architect_A39 : no, sorry 23 : Architect_A39 : the thing makes a large V 24 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 25 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2] 26 : System : [Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-2] 27 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3] 28 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-3] 29 : Builder_B49 : ok 30 : Architect_A39 : okay, on the ground in front of each of the tips of the V, place an orange block 31 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4] 32 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4] 33 : Architect_A39 : oops sorry, I meant behind :) 34 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-4] 35 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-4] 36 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-2] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2] 38 : Builder_B49 : ok 39 : Architect_A39 : so these are each going to be the starting step of a staircase going upwards 40 : Architect_A39 : we can just start on the left side for now, and you can do the same on the right side 41 : Architect_A39 : so you'll want two more orange blocks going diagonally up and away from the first orange block 42 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-1] 44 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 45 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 46 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-1] 47 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-2] 48 : Architect_A39 : looks good. do the same for the other side 49 : Builder_B49 : more on the left? 50 : Architect_A39 : nope, that's it 51 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2] 52 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1] 53 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1] 54 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0] 55 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1] 56 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2] 57 : Architect_A39 : okay, on the ends of those top orange blocks, facing away from you, put a red block on each 58 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 59 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0] 61 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0] 62 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1] 64 : Builder_B49 : ok 65 : Architect_A39 : now, we're going to make the same V-shape that's on the ground in yellow, but using red and it will be standing up to meet those two red blocks we placed 66 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1] 68 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1] 69 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1] 70 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1] 71 : Builder_B49 : cool shape 72 : Architect_A39 : yup! and lastly, make an upside-down V in red that also uses those blocks as the ends 73 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:1] 74 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1] 75 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1] 76 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:1] 77 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1] 78 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1] 79 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 80 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1] 81 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1] 82 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:1] 83 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:1] 84 : Builder_B49 : done i think 85 : Architect_A39 : we did it!
