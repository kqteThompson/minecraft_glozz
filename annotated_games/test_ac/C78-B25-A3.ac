 0 : Builder_B25 : Mission has started. 1 : Architect_A3 : ok this one is weird 2 : Architect_A3 : easy part is a big yellow arch. we'll start with that 3 : Builder_B25 : ok, where should i start? 4 : Architect_A3 : like 1 or 2 blocks to the left of center place 6 yellow blocks straight up 5 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1] 6 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-1] 7 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1] 8 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:4 Z:-1] 9 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:5 Z:-1] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:6 Z:-1] 11 : Architect_A3 : yeah like that. then put 4 more across the top going to the right 12 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:2 Y:6 Z:-1] 13 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-1] 14 : Builder_B25 : sounds good 15 : Architect_A3 : need 2 more to go across the top 16 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1] 17 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1] 18 : Architect_A3 : nice 19 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1] 20 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-1] 21 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1] 22 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1] 23 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1] 24 : Architect_A3 : yeah like that 25 : Builder_B25 : ok, what else are we looking at? 26 : Architect_A3 : ok the rest of the figure uses red and orange blocks in a random pattern 27 : Builder_B25 : on the ground, on the arch, in the air, or both? 28 : Architect_A3 : we'll just go 1 at a time its pretty weird 29 : Builder_B25 : ok 30 : Architect_A3 : place the first red block on the inner left side of the arch, 1 space toward you 31 : Builder_B25 : i'll stay in a fixed position so it's easier to give me directions with respect to what i'm looking at 32 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-2] 33 : Builder_B25 : like that? 34 : Architect_A3 : right sounds good. ok then place 1 to the right of that new red block 35 : Architect_A3 : yeah perfect 36 : Builder_B25 : another red block? 37 : Architect_A3 : yeah anothe rred 38 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2] 39 : Architect_A3 : then 1 red on top of the right red 40 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2] 41 : Architect_A3 : then another red to the bottom right of the right ground red block. so its connected but diagonal on the ground 42 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-3] 43 : Architect_A3 : yeah 44 : Architect_A3 : same thing to the new red block 45 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-4] 46 : Architect_A3 : then 1 more on the side toward you of that new red block 47 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5] 48 : Architect_A3 : not diagonal though, just straight 49 : Builder_B25 : oh o 50 : Builder_B25 : ok* 51 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-5] 52 : Architect_A3 : my bad 53 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-5] 54 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-5] 55 : Builder_B25 : no problem 56 : Architect_A3 : ok thats it for red. now we do orange which all look to be in the air 57 : Architect_A3 : come around to the other side pls 58 : Architect_A3 : ok first orange block goes inside the arch connected to the topmost red block so that it comes toward you 59 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1] 60 : Architect_A3 : then there are 2 more orange blocks that go diagonally the the left of that one while raising up in the air 1 space each time. so we need placeholders 61 : Builder_B25 : wait i think I got this 62 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0] 63 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 64 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 65 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0] 66 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 67 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0] 68 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1] 69 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1] 70 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:0] 71 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1] 72 : Builder_B25 : like that? 73 : Architect_A3 : yeah just like that. let me take a look and make sure it's all right 74 : Architect_A3 : awesome i think we did it 75 : Builder_B25 : is this ketchup and cheddar take mcdonalds or something 76 : Architect_A3 : could be 77 : Architect_A3 : golden arch :) 78 : Builder_B25 : next one?
