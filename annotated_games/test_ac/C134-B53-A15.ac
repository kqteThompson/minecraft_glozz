 0 : Builder_B53 : Mission has started. 1 : Architect_A15 : this one's a rainbow ring 2 : Architect_A15 : start with a floating red block one tile above the center 3 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 4 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 5 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0] 6 : Architect_A15 : now, an orange block one tile above and away from that 7 : Architect_A15 : any direction is fine, just not directly above 8 : Builder_B53 : gotcha 9 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 10 : System : [Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 11 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 12 : Architect_A15 : the position is good, but it should be orange 13 : Builder_B53 : Oops 14 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0] 15 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 16 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 17 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 18 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 19 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-1] 20 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1] 21 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0] 22 : Architect_A15 : two more orange blocks in the same trajectory :) 23 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 24 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-2] 25 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3] 26 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-3] 27 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-3] 28 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:-2] 29 : Architect_A15 : cool. now make a row of 3 yellow blocks on top of that, perpendicular 30 : Architect_A15 : to the rest of them* 31 : Builder_B53 : Centered? 32 : Architect_A15 : centered, yeah 33 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-3] 34 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-3] 35 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:6 Z:-3] 36 : Architect_A15 : now a row of 3 green bending upwards and back towards the red block in a staircase 37 : Builder_B53 : Should they mirror the orange blocks? 38 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-3] 39 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-2] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-2] 41 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-2] 42 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:9 Z:-2] 43 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:9 Z:-1] 44 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:9 Z:-2] 45 : Architect_A15 : no, sorry, the row of green should be parallel to the ywellow 46 : Architect_A15 : it's a weird ring 47 : Builder_B53 : I don't think I understand 48 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:9 Z:-1] 49 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-2] 50 : Architect_A15 : okay, start with 3 green blocks directly on top of the 3 yellow ones 51 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-3] 52 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-3] 53 : Architect_A15 : put another row next to them, above the 2nd highest orange block 54 : Builder_B53 : Oh, so now we're building a staircase out of rows? 55 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-2] 56 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-2] 57 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-2] 58 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-3] 59 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-2] 60 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:-2] 61 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-3] 62 : Architect_A15 : precisely! 63 : Builder_B53 : one more, yes? 64 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:-1] 65 : Architect_A15 : no not yet 66 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:-1] 67 : System : [Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0] 68 : Builder_B53 : Now what? 69 : Architect_A15 : the 2nd row should be one tile down 70 : Architect_A15 : at the same height as the first noe 71 : Architect_A15 : one* 72 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:2 Y:8 Z:-2] 73 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:2 Y:8 Z:-2] 74 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-2] 75 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-2] 76 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:-2] 77 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-2] 78 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-2] 79 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-2] 80 : Architect_A15 : and now delete the first row of green 81 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-3] 82 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-3] 83 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:-3] 84 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-3] 85 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:-3] 86 : Architect_A15 : good! now make a row of blue in the same trajectory as the yellow and green 87 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-2] 88 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-1] 89 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-1] 90 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-1] 91 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:8 Z:-2] 92 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-1] 93 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:-1] 94 : Builder_B53 : Hopefully I understood that time 95 : Architect_A15 : perfect! and a row of purple directly adjacent, at the same height 96 : Builder_B53 : Adjacecnt to the left? 97 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:8 Z:0] 98 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:8 Z:0] 99 : System : [Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:0] 100 : Architect_A15 : yes, perfect! 101 : Architect_A15 : now that structure should be mirrored, starting with a row of blue next to the purple 102 : Builder_B53 : Ok, are all of the colors the same on the other side? 103 : Architect_A15 : so no more red or purple blocks 104 : Architect_A15 : yes :) 105 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:8 Z:1] 106 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:8 Z:1] 107 : System : [Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:9 Z:1] 108 : System : [Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:8 Z:1] 109 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1] 110 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1] 111 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1] 112 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1] 113 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:2] 114 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:1] 115 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:3] 116 : System : [Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:3] 117 : System : [Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:3] 118 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:3] 119 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:3] 120 : System : [Builder puts down a yellow block at X:1 Y:6 Z:3] 121 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:3] 122 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:2] 123 : System : [Builder picks up a green block at X:1 Y:7 Z:3] 124 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:7 Z:2] 125 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:2] 126 : Architect_A15 : looks perfect! :) 127 : Builder_B53 : Cool!
