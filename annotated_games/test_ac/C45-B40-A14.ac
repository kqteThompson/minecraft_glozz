Now place another green block next to the green one on the right so that it juts out of the square 34 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2] 35 : Architect_A14 : Perfect. Now place two green blocks behind it 36 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:3] 37 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:4] 38 : Architect_A14 : Great, this is the last step. Place two green blocks right next to the one jutting out 39 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:4] 40 : System : [Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4] 41 : Builder_B40 : done? 42 : Architect_A14 : yes done! 43 : Builder_B40 : :)
